        "Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name's Tom and welcome to my Portfolio Website! <br/><br/>

I didnâ€™t grow up with computers, but over the past year, Iâ€™ve become deeply fascinated with the world of technology. What started as a curiosity turned into a passion that drives me to spend every moment learning, building, and experimenting. From coding challenges to full-stack projects, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in this incredible field, constantly pushing myself to grow and improve. <br/><br/>

This portfolio showcases my journey so far, highlighting the projects Iâ€™ve created and the skills Iâ€™ve developed along the way. Each piece represents not just a technical achievement but also my dedication to problem-solving, creativity, and continuous learning. <br/><br/>

Thank you for visiting, and I hope my work inspires you as much as this journey has inspired me!"
