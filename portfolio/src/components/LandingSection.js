const description2 = `I didnâ€™t grow up with computers, but over the past year, Iâ€™ve become deeply fascinated with the world of technology. What started as a curiosity turned into a passion that drives me to spend every moment learning, building, and experimenting. Recently, I completed an intensive 10-month coding bootcamp at Coder Academy, where I honed my skills in full-stack development and tackled real-world projects. Iâ€™m now excited to take the next step and find a role where I can contribute, grow, and continue this incredible journey.`

const description3 = `This portfolio showcases my journey so far, highlighting a few of the projects Iâ€™ve created, and the skills Iâ€™ve developed along the way. Each piece represents not just a technical achievement but also my dedication to problem-solving, creativity, and continuous learning.` 

const description4 = `Thank you for visiting, and I hope my work inspires you as much as this journey has inspired me!`
